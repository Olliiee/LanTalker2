FSLanTalker2 is a simple server application. It provides access to the Microsoft Flight Simulator via a network.
It is intended as a possible alternative to WideFS. Keep in mind, it works only with third party applications which 
are adapted to FSLanTalker2.
The implemented protocol was a quick and dirty solution for another project. An update in the near futur is possible.

To use FSLanTalker 2, start it and connect your application to the server. That's it.
