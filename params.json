It provides access to the Microsoft Flight Simulator via a network. It is intended as a possible alternative to WideFS. Keep in mind, it works only with third party applications which \r\nare adapted to FSLanTalker2.\r\nThe implemented protocol was a quick and dirty solution for another project. An update in the near futur is possible.\r\n\r\nTo use FSLanTalker 2, start it and connect your application to the server. That's it.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
